For 10ms delay:

Atmega operating frequency = 8MHz = 8000000Hz
Prescalar for timer clock frequency = 1024
F timer clock = 8000000Hz/1024 = 7812.5Hz
Time period for each timer tick = 1/7812.5 = 128us
Number of timer cycles needed to generate delay = Time delay required/Time taken for each
10ms/128us = (10*10^-3)/(128*10^-6) = 78.125 ~ 78 cycles
 value to be put in TCNT0 register = 256-78 = 178 or 0xB2

1/10MHz = .1us
1/1MHz = 1us
